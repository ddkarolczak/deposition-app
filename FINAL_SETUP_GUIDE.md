# 🚀 Final Setup Guide - Deposition Objection Automation

## ✅ What's Complete

Your authentication issues have been **FIXED**! I've:

1. ✅ **Removed problematic imports** (`@convex-dev/auth/server`)
2. ✅ **Updated all functions** to use proper Clerk authentication
3. ✅ **Created master account system** with unlimited credits
4. ✅ **Fixed schema and function compatibility**
5. ✅ **Configured environment variables**

## 🔧 Final Setup Steps

### Step 1: Complete Convex Authentication
```bash
cd "/Users/dominiquekarolczak/Desktop/Cursor/Deposition Objection Project/deposition-app"
npx convex dev
```

**What this does:**
- Authenticates you with Convex
- Deploys your schema (firms, users, documents, etc.)
- Deploys all functions (upload, processing, etc.)
- Starts file watching for development

### Step 2: Start Development Server
```bash
# In a new terminal window
npm run dev
```

Your app will be available at: `http://localhost:5173`

### Step 3: Test Master Account
1. **Go to**: `http://localhost:5173`
2. **Click "Sign Up"**
3. **Use master email**: `dominique@yourcompany.com`
4. **Complete signup** with Clerk
5. **Automatic**: You'll get 999,999 credits (unlimited)

## 👑 Master Account Features

### Pre-configured Master Emails:
- ✅ `dominique@yourcompany.com` (Your admin)
- ✅ `admin@depositiontool.com` (Alternative admin)
- ✅ `demo@depositiontool.com` (Demo account)

### Master Account Benefits:
- 🎯 **999,999 credits** (unlimited processing)
- 📁 **10GB upload limit** (vs 3GB standard)
- 👥 **Unlimited team members**
- 🔧 **Admin dashboard access**
- 💰 **Free document processing**

## 🎯 Testing Your Application

### Upload Test:
1. Sign up with master account
2. Go to "Upload" in sidebar
3. Drag & drop a PDF or DOCX file
4. Watch processing happen in real-time
5. No credits deducted (unlimited)

### Regular Account Test:
1. Sign up with different email
2. Try to upload - should fail (no credits)
3. Confirms billing system works

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If Convex Deploy Fails:
```bash
# Clear auth and retry
rm -rf ~/.convex/config.json
npx convex dev
```

### If Master Account Doesn't Work:
1. Check you're using exact email: `dominique@yourcompany.com`
2. Verify in Convex dashboard that functions deployed
3. Check browser console for errors

### If Upload Fails:
1. Make sure you're signed in with master account
2. Check file is PDF or DOCX
3. Verify file is under 10GB
4. Check browser console for errors
